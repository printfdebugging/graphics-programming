# Graphics Programming

Graphics programming  to me means  the ability of  creating windows on  the user's
screen and  displaying "potentially anything" in  it. C is the  language of choice
since all the graphics APIs are written  in C. The choice was also influenced from
the fact  that major voices in  the graphics programming space  discourage OOP and
languages like  C++ which over time  condition the programmer's brain  to think of
the  solution from  the  language's  perspective rather  than  the from  problem's
perspective.

I  would be  using the  following libraries/languages  -- [C],  [Lua], [Makefile],
[GLFW], [OpenGL], [Vulkan]. If you don't have any idea about any of these, :smile:
we are in the same :boat:.
