# A Craftsman's Understanding of Life

Over the last 3 years of my college I have learnt a lot of things about myself and
my relation  to this world.  Now I  think that being  an introvert is  cool, after
having rushed into several projects, now I know that programming not a sprint.

I hope I learnt and understood these things  sooner, then I would have saved a lot
of time,  not that it's too  late or anything just  that it's better to  learn the
lesson without falling into the same pit several times, but that hardly happens.

## Knowing Where the Day Goes

For so long, I just  let the day/my mood decide what I will do  that day. I wish I
had organized my calendar in a "sane  way". I either completely went with the flow
of things, or whenever  I made plans, most of them were  very impractical made not
for me but for the image that I had about myself.

Considering  one wants  to progress  in the  profession/field they  are in,  there
should be plans in place for today,  tomorrow, this week, the next week etc. which
point in that direction. Such an obvious thing I couldn't understand for so long.
